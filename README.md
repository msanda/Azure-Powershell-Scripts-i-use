The scripts
=============

This is a bunch of scripts i use on a daily basis for azure related stuff. Since this is work in progress most of the scripts are meant to be run through ise, and not via the command line with parameters. 

Getting Started
-------------------------

# Right click file, and open in Powershell ISE


TODO
-------------
parameterized the Scripts and make some of them into modules for easier use.
